# Panorama-Creation

This project aims to stitch multiple images together to create a panorama using the homography transformation. The code provided employs the Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) algorithm to robustly estimate the homography matrix despite potential outliers.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Output

The stitched panorama image will be displayed after the code execution.
